# railfence-python
Encryption Application, using a Rail Fence Cipher, in Python

Summary:
  This application takes in a string of any length and returns it in encrypted form, by placing each character into a matrix in a zig-zag (ie. a rail fence) pattern, and putting it back together row by row. The matrix is defined by the length of the string passed in (-> number of columns) and the encryption key, which is also input by the user (-> number of rows). Additionally, an offset value can be passed in, which changes the starting row of the encryption.
